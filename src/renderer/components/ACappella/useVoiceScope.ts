/**
 * What the voice session is bound to, in the words and colour the HUD shows.
 *
 * This is the single most important line in the widget. Everything else on
 * screen is feedback about a turn that already happened; this says where the
 * NEXT sentence is going to land. Speaking a refactor instruction into the wrong
 * repository is the failure mode the whole HUD exists to prevent, so the scope
 * gets the agent's own colour, its name, and the tab the last dispatch actually
 * used - not a generic "connected" pill.
 *
 * The tab comes from `lastDispatch` rather than from the scope, because the
 * scope only names an agent. Which TAB a prompt landed in is decided per turn by
 * the router, and it is the part a user is most likely to have lost track of.
