/**
 * useVoiceAgentActions - the voice actions available for a single agent.
 *
 * Three surfaces offer "Talk to this agent": the microphone under the composer's
 * Send button, the Left Bar right-click menu, and the command palette. They all
 * call this hook rather than each re-deriving the Encore gate, the scope shape,
 * and the IPC call, for the same reason `useGitAgentActions` exists - three
 * implementations of one menu entry drift, and the one that drifts is always the
 * one the user reaches for.
 *
 * It also owns jumping to a tab a turn was dispatched into, because that is the
 * other direction of the same relationship: the transcript's route chips, and
 * anything else that wants to answer "where did that go", land here.
